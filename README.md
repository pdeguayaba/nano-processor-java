# Nano Processor
**Version 1.0.0**

Nano processor for the Operating Systems course.

You can use the included [myCode.txt](https://github.com/pdeguayaba/nano-processor-java/blob/master/myCode.txt) file included in the repo. It contains a number of addresses to feed the processor.

##### Remember to change these if you're using another *.txt* file and/or if it's located elsewhere:
```Java
String file = "\\myCode.txt";
String path = new File("").getAbsolutePath();
```
